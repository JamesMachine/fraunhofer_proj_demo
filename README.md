# Data Science Projects by James


## Greetings and Introduction
Hello! Welcome to my GitHub repository. I am a Data Science student at Fachhochschule Kiel. This repository contains various projects I have worked on during my academic journey.

## About This Repository
This repository showcases several data science projects I completed as part of my coursework. Each project is designed to align with the specific focus and learning objectives of the courses I took at Fachhochschule Kiel. As a result, the approaches and methodologies employed in these projects were guided by course requirements.

## Scope and Limitations
While these projects provided valuable hands-on experience and deepened my understanding of data science principles, it is important to note that they may not always represent the most conventional or typical methods used in real-world scenarios. The constraints and objectives of the coursework sometimes necessitated specific approaches that differ from industry practices.

## Projects Included

1. Japan Earthquake Forecasting (Phase 1)

  - **Course:** Mathematics and Multivariate Statistics
  - **Brief Description:** Aim at identifying hidden earthquake patterns from 30 days historical weather data
  - **Approach:**
    - Scraped Dates of earthquakes in Japan for 50 years
    - Scraped 30 days Historical Weather Data against the coresponding dates on hourly basis
    - Performed basic feature distributions initial data analysis
    - Performed covariance check
    - Applied PCA
    - Applied OPTICS
    - Applied GMM
  - **Techniques:** Clusterings | PCA

2. **Diabetes Detection**

- **Course:** Machine Learning
- **Brief Description:** Develop a machine learning solution for early diabetes detection
- **Approach:**
  - Performed initial data analysis on features
  - Prepared Basedline Model (Dummy Classifier)
  - Experimented the effect of different hyperparameters on models (Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM)
  - Applied Cross-validation and random search for hyperparameter optimization
  - Chosed the best model
  - Fine-tuned the best model by applying Grid-search
- **Techniques:** Decision Tree | KNN | SVM | Cross-validation | Grid/Random-Search CV

3. **Kiel Road Accidents Analysis**

- **Course:** Data Visualization
- **Brief Description:** Analyze the road accidents in Kiel by visualizaion methods
- **Approach:**
  - Shown Number of accidents per district
  - Shown Vehicles or Pedestrian involved, Weekday and Hour Breakdown
  - Classified Most Dangerous Roads
  - Labeled Most accidents Spots
  - Checked Medical Rescue Facilities
- **Techniques:** GeoPandas | Altair | OSMnx
